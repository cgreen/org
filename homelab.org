The SATA controller seems to have an issue with the drives.  This may be a problem with the AOC-SAT2-MV8 HBAs (MV88SX6081).

Trying to download new firmware for the AOC-SAT2-MV8 from Supermicro, but the link to the flash utility is broken.

*** Setup an NFS share on Mynoghra so that Nyarlathotep can access the OS ISOs
This task may have been created before the storage server was renamed to Cthulhu, but the
better plan is to copy the ISOs to the storage server.
- Verify that nfs-kernel-server was installed on Mynoghra
- Add directories to be shared to /etc/exports
- Set appropriate permissions on shared files (644) and dirs (755).
- Start securing NFS by restricting the hosts that can use the portmapper.  http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NFS-HOWTO/security.html
- Set ports for necessary services and open firewall: https://wiki.debian.org/SecuringNFS
- Add firewall rule to open port 37491 for showmount.

Need to reinstall cuda.  Will likely have to settle for a driver downgrade (430->418).
- Installed cuda-10.1
- Installed nvidia-docker2
- Compiled cuda samples and ran deviceQuery & bandwidthTest - both passed.
- Running nvidia-docker (sudo nvidia-docker run -d -e username=cagreen74@hotmail.com -e donate=1 servethehome/monero_gpu_nv_minergate)

*** DONE Get QEMU / virt-manager working on Mynoghra
   CLOSED: [2019-07-08 Mon 11:48]
virt-manager was already installed, but I couldn't view the VM desktop due to a spice error.
Had to install gir1.2-spiceclientgtk-3.0 to get it working.  I also installed spice-client-gtk, but I don't know if it was needed.
Note: these dependencies might be handle by installing "recommended" packages when installing virt-manager.
The virtual network (default) is refusing to start because it "failed to initialize a valid firewall backend."
According to a reply on https://superuser.com/questions/1063240/libvirt-failed-to-initialize-a-valid-firewall-backend, ebtables and dnsmasq need to be started.
Installed ebtables and dnsmasq, but it didn't help.
Restarted libvirtd: sudo systemctl restart libvirtd.service
Updated libvirt package.
Virtual network is now active.
Had to switch VM net device back to virtual network.

*** DONE Install kdenlive for video editing on Mynoghra
   CLOSED: [2019-08-23 Fri 23:34]
Installed via flatpak, since the latest version isn't compatible with the QT in ubuntu 18.04 based distros

*** DONE Make scanning documents from Brother DCP-L2540DW to Mynoghra work

*** DONE Flash Dell PERC H200 adapter to IT mode (HBA)
   CLOSED: [2019-06-02 Sun 14:27]
Followed this guide, but had to install the card in another computer to get megarec to run as it would hang when run on the R710 under any combination of BIOS/UEFI boot and all FreeDOS boot options.
https://www.ixsystems.com/community/resources/detailed-newcomers-guide-to-crossflashing-lsi-9211-9300-9311-hba-and-variants.54/
Note: the guide says that flashing a boot option ROM to the card isn't necessary, but I had to do so in order to boot off of the attached drives.
I was able to connect the mini SAS ports on the adapter to the backplanes using a 0.7m (SFF-8087) cable, but I wasn't able to route it through the guides built into the chassis as the adapter was installed on the 2nd riser as that's where the PCIe 8x connections are.
Note: ProxMox was installed when the computer was booted in UEFI mode, but the computer is now in BIOS mode and the OS still boots.
